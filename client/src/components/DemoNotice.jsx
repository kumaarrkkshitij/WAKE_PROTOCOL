      It runs on a <strong>simulated backend</strong>: everything you add is
      stored in your own browser, is shared with nobody, and disappears when you
      clear your browsing data. There is no server and no database behind this
      page. The full version runs against an Express API and a PostgreSQL
      database, deployed separately. See the README.
